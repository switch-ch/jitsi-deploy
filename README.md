# The SWITCH scalable Jitsi Installation

22.3.2020

SWITCH is the Swiss National Research and Education Network (NREN) and provides various IT services
to Swiss higher education institutions. This ansible playbook is used to set up
a cluster of individual Jitsi Frontend servers (one for each insitiution) that share a
pool of videobridges. This is a brand new service that was started during the Covid19 crisis
in March 2020. A service description can be found at https://switch.ch/meet

This repository is provided **AS IS** under a MIT license without any implicit or explicit guarantees
that it will work for you.

The setup is geared towards our needs and will most likely not work out of the box for you.

Things to look out for:

* We provision VMs on our internal IaaS cloud SWITChengines (https://switch.ch/engines) using the
  `build*servers` playbooks. You will need to adapt that to your environment
* We use an internal ansible role (`users`) that provisions our admin users onto our VMs. You will
  need to roll your own. For now, remove the `users` role entry in `provision.yml`
* We use Ubuntu 18.04 as a base operating system. No other configurations have been or will be tested
* We use Shibboleth Authentication. If you are not part of the universities, chances are you will not
  need to know how that works. Remove the `shib` role entry in `provision.yml`
* We use https://site24x7.com for monitoring. The playbook sets up automatic server monitoring. Again,
  remove the `site24x7` role from `provision.yml`

Create your own directories for `group_vars`, `hosts_vars` and `inventory`
Or use the ansible-galaxy approach, then use

    $ cd ansible
    $ ansible-galaxy install -fr roles/requirements.yml


## Adding a new service VM (this is very SWITCH specific)

The follwowing steps guides you through a building process of a new `Jitsi Meet` instance.

* Initially, change `jitsi-ORGANISATION` in `build_jitsi_server.yml`.

* Source the corresponding project, use `openrc.sample` as a guidance.

      $ ansible-playbook build_jitsi_server.yml -D

**Important:** Variables such as inventory, host_vars and group_vars go into `jitsi-deploy-vars` repo! (ansible-galaxy)
*  This will display the IPv4 and IPv6 of the instance. Add the host into `inventory/production`
* Copy `host_vars/template.meet.example.com` folder, to `ORGANISATION.meet.switch.ch` and change the values such as:
  * SSL certificate (vars.yml and vault.yml)
  * callstat.io credentials
    
    **Note:** The callstats credentials can be requested on our organisation page at [callstats.io](https://dashboard.callstats.io).
  * Think about `shibboleth`. Shall it be enabled?! If yes, set `jitsi_shib: yes` in vars.yml.
* Ask for DNS entry `ORGANISATION.meet.switch.ch` with IPv4 & IPv6 info
* Special Parameters:
  * Shibboleth Entity (same as Hostname)
  * WAYF - use https://www.switch.ch/aai/participants/allhomeorgs-expert/ to find it
* When all values are filled out (except of the shib-cert and shib-key), you can run:

      $ ansible-playbook -i inventory/production main.yml -e ansible_user=ubuntu --limit new_host.meet.example.com

  * Remove `-e ansible_user=ubuntu` when you reinstall the host! Users will be installed during initial run.
* You can limit the playbook runs to specific tasks with the following tags
  * `conf` - only deploy configuration changes (and restart services where necessary)
  * `webconf` - only deploy the web config of jitsi-meet (no service disruption)
  * `nginx` - only install/configure Nginx
  * `jitsi` - only install/configure Jitsi
  * `shib` - only install/configure Shibboleth

  * Example:

        $ ansible-playbook -i inventory/production main.yml --limit new.host.meet.ch --tags conf

* If shiboleth is enabled --> request an RR:
  * login to the server and get the fingerprint of the AAI Shib certificate and `/etc/shibboleth/sp-cert.pem`  
  
      ```
      $ openssl x509 -in /etc/shibboleth/sp-cert.pem -fingerprint -sha1 -noout
      ```

  * copy the `sp-cert.pem` and `sp-key.pem` to your local machine in `host_vars/ORGANISATION.meet.switch.ch/vars.yml | vault.yml`
  * create the RR request at https://rr.aai.switch.ch
    * Name: hostname
    * Entity ID: hostname
    * Home Org: SWITCH
    * Description: "VideoConf service for UNI provided by SWITCH"
    * For support contacts:
      * FirstName: support
      * LastName: support
      * mail: support@switch.ch
    * Attributes:
      * Required: mail, firstname, givename, uniqueid
    * Audience:
      * Limit to the requesting organisation
      * exclude the EduID
    * Paste the Fingerprint into the comment field at the end    
  * wait for the approval.

* Done. You should have a new host for the specific organisation.

* **Note:** Videobridges have to be configured with the new hosts. VBs have to authenticate to the MUC on the new server. *Until then, no meetings are possible.*)
This can be done with:

      $ ansible-playbook -i inventory/production main.yml --limit videobridge -D

* **Note:** Configuration will only apply when VBs are restarted. Mind the active meetings on the VB instances!!!

## Add a new videobridge server

### switch-net

The new [Transform's switch-net](https://gitlab-int.switch.ch/transform/transform-net) gives us unNATed, unfiltered IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) in the SWITCH network ranges.

The `switch-net` were add to the `videobridges.meet.switch.ch` project in ZH and LS as decribed in [Self-Service Port Allocation](https://gitlab-int.switch.ch/transform/transform-net#self-service-port-allocation)

### Create and provision videobridge server

* Source credentials of the `videobridges.meet.switch.ch` project!
* Add new entry in `inventory/production` in the section `videobridge`. (LS or ZH)
* Run the following command to build:
  * **Important:** Comment out existing VBs in order to speed up the build process! From **both** `videobridge_zh` and `videobridge_ls`!

        $ ansible-playbook -i inventory/production build_videobridge_servers.yml -D

* Write the IPs with `ansible_host` to the host `inventory/production`
* Assure that you filled in the `callstats.io` credentials in `group_vars/videobrdiges/vars.yml` (**Should already be present!**)
* Execute the following playbook:

      $ ansible-playbook -i inventory/production main.yml -e ansible_user=ubuntu --limit jitsi-videobridge-XXXX.videobridges.meet.switch.ch
      
### Create and provision coturn server

* Source credentials of the `videobridges.meet.switch.ch` project!
* Add new entry in `inventory/production` in the section `coturn`. (LS or ZH)
* Run the following command to build:
  * **Important:** Comment out existing coturns in order to speed up the build process! From **both** `coturn_zh` and `coturn_ls`!

        $ ansible-playbook -i inventory/production build_coturn_servers.yml -D

* Write the IPs with `ansible_host` to the host `inventory/production`
* Execute the following playbook:

      $ ansible-playbook -i inventory/production main.yml -e ansible_user=ubuntu --limit jitsi-coturn-XXXX.meet.switch.ch

#### Testing STUN/TURN

*NB*: Be sure to test this while NOT on the VPN.

To test if STUN/TURN is working, open a conference in three tabs of the browser and disable outgoing UDP packets
to port 10000. On Mac OSX:

    # set rule to block outgoing traffic udp 10000
    $ (sudo pfctl -sr 2>/dev/null; echo "block drop out quick on en0 proto udp from any to any port = 10000 no state") | sudo pfctl -f -
    # enable the PacketFilter (pf) firewall
    # sudo pfctl -e
    
If STUN/TURN works, the images of the two "remote" participants (i.e. the other browser tabs) should continue to show
video. In addition the note `(stun)` is added in the `Show More` information of the network data.

If it doesn't work, the remote participants will show no video (and have no audio obviously).

To display information about `pf`
    
    # verbose listing of rules
    $ sudo pfctl -v -s rules
    
To reset the firewall

    # Disable pf
    $ sudo pfctl -d
    # Reload the default rules
    $ sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf

## Add jibri service

* There is a build script which deploys new jibri servers. (`build_jibri_server.yml`) 
* Add a new server to `inventory/production`
  * **Important:** Please comment out the existing servers! From **both** `jibri_zh` and `jibri_ls`!
* Source the project's `.openrc` file and run:

      $ ansible-playbook -i inventory/production build_jibri_server.yml -D

* **Note:** Script loops over the `jibri` group and creates new hosts in the given project.
* Add the respective IPs into `inventory/production`

## Purge Services

While installing and trying to get things working, you might want to purge all traces of
*nginx* or *jitsi* from your servers. Use the `purge.yml` playbook like so:

    $ ansible-playbook -i inventory/production purge.yml --limit ORGANISATION.meet.example.com

Specify one (or more of the following tags) with `--tags ...`
  * `nginx` - remove nginx from server
  * `jitsi` - remove all traces of jitsi / prosody etc from the server
  * `jicofolog` - truncate the jicofo logs

## Reinstallation of a service
It might happen that things get broken, so you can redeploy the `Jitsi Meet` instance easily. 
* Run:

      //Purge instance
      $ ansible-playbook -i inventory/production purge.yml --limit ORGANISATION.meet.example.com

      // Reinstall services
      $ ansible-playbook -i inventory/production main.yml --limit ORGANISATION.meet.example.com -D
